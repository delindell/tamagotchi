# tamagotchi

## Description
In this project we built upon our previous knowledge of using ES6 modules to create a Tamagotchi.  The Tamagotchi has several buttons that increase or decrease the score corresponding to the button pressed. This was the first project in which we used SASS to style. With the SASS I created several variables for colors, and other various styling methods.
